            Goats were introduced to New Zealand in the early days of European
            settlement for food, to establish a commercial fibre industry, and
            for weed control on developing land. The descendents of those that
            escaped or were deliberately released thrived in the countryâ€™s grass
            hills, forest and scrubland areas. Today feral goats (Capra hircus)
            occur on both main islands and a few offshore islands. Feral goats
            are classifed as wild animals under the Wild Animal Control Act
            1977.
